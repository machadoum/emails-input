Why roolup?
OVERDOCUMENTATION
given the amount of requirements and the time thta I had available I've decided the not too much effort into e-mail validation and random e-mail gerenation.

postcss -> the example has no css dependency

TODO

- ​GitHub Pages​.
- Link git repository (built version)
- README Examples + documentation
- Test on firefox, safari and IE 11
- Verify duplicated e-mails
- Several emails editors on the same page
